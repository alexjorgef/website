# Library

We all have different and unique pleasures, and why not share them? Here are some of my personal collections on various subjects.

## Music

I often mix music and take the opportunity to record. With already <MixcloudPlayCount /> plays, I share the mixtapes here at [/lib/mixtapes](/lib/mixtapes) page. You can also check my music wishlists at [/lib/wishlist](/lib/wishlist).

## Design

I like to play around with some computer graphics software to make procedural/generative designs, check it out at [/lib/generative](/lib/generative).
