# Uses

## What is a `/uses` page?

A `/uses` page is a trend started by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses) where one lists the hardware and software they use to make them a great developer! Wes has also created a page called [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) as a directory for everyone else's `/uses` pages.

## What I Use

I'm always trying to find ways to improve my workstation, this is a living document of the software, tools, and hardware I use.
